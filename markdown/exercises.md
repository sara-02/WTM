# Exercise instructions
Here you can find instructions for exercises during the workshop.

---

### Prerequisites
These instructions assume you have Docker installed and running ([locally](install-local.md), or in the [Cloud](install-cloud.md)), and that you have practiced using the workshop image as described in those instructions. Make sure you know how to do these things before you start:

* Start the container

* Copy files between your laptop and the running container

* Start and connect to the IPython Notebook server

The commands in each exercise assume you are using the Docker image. If you have installed these libraries another way, see their github pages.

## 1. Fast Style Transfer
This is the simplest method. In this exercise, you'll stylize an image you provide to resemble work by one of five different artists. Click [here](fast-style-transfer.md) for instructions.

## 2. Magenta - Style Transfer
Here, you will stylize an image by mixing and matching up to 32 different styles at the same time (you can even specify exactly how much of each style you'd like blended in). Sound interesting? Head on over to the [instructions](magenta-style-transfer.md).

## 3. Basic MNIST
Write a basic classifier for handwritten digits by following these [instructions](basic_mnist.md).

## As time remains
Finished ahead of schedule? If you'd like to dive deeper with higher level APIs, we recommend you try this [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/estimators) to learn how to write a custom estimator. Alternatively, consider working through the basic and deep mnist tutorials on [tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org).
